Some ideas for potential scripts include -
* Screen recording scripts (can use external tools)
* File management scripts
* Generating 'table of contents' for reports (might use LaTeX)
* Automating lab works (calculations and graph plotting)
* Fetching important campus notices using RSS
* Automating social media posts for the club, and more.
